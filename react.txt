Adding React to our project:

    npx create-react-app my-app
    cd my-app
    npm start






JSX == Javascript with HTML Tags

JSX Interpolation == HTML Tags having their content dependant on 
                    javascript variables(pretty much like simulating 
                    useState Hook) 

Babel == Allows us to use React without using create-react-app
